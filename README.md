Version Control for Social Media & Content Creators :
• Unified Content Repository : 
* Platform for content from various social media content creators (YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Threads), for users to access a version control system for artists, 
photographers, designers, musicians & creative professionals.
* creators can track changes, edit, revert to an older version of the content, collaborated with other creators .
• Content Generation and Collaborative Editing: 
* Fellow creators can create a copy/fork of the original content – make desired changes or request AI-generated content or community edits. 
* These contributions can be managed through a pull-requests, where the owner can merge or replace the original content with suggested edits.
* Empower new creators to leverage AI and NLP capabilities to generate content for audience through prompts (includes videos, images, music, transcripts, captions, 
tweets, text for video)
* Enables direct publishing to social platforms by automating workflows of content, captions, ads hashtags and schedule posts to create engaging content efficiently.
* Enable AI - language translation of videos, such as Spanish to English, to reach a broader audience. 
* Edit existing content to add AI-generated content via voice commands (NLP) : Ex : Add a 3 second animation on harmonics of waves) or manually – enhances 
online learning 
* Filtering inappropriate content/prompts editing (if opted by owner)
• Content Suggestions and Elaboration :
* Scrape the web to provide content-consumption suggestions based on the creator’s domain, following and past content to update with latest trends.
* User’s con get quick elaboration on some parts of the content. Ex : A scholarship by DAOs – click ‘elaborated’ – get a brief on ‘What’s DAO ‘ 
* Recommendations on content formats that suit different platforms, such as video for YouTube, tweets for Twitter, and concise text for Instagram.
• Ad Generation & Hashtag Recommendations : 
* Ads for relevant content or based on hashtags or a user-requested prompts, ads can be generated and layered to existing content.
* Implement AI to suggest relevant hashtags based on the content and target audience, trends optimizing content visibility and discoverability.
• Performance Analytics : Insights on the performance of content includes metrics like engagement, reach, and audience demographics and suggestions to help content creators 
optimize strategies.
• Content Format Conversion : Tools to convert content between different formats, such as converting a video to a tweet or extracting key points from a YouTube video to create a 
concise Instagram post.
• Customizable Content Templates with AI-generated suggestions, allowing content creators to adapt and personalize the suggested content to align with their brand and style. 
They can also publish their templates for other creators


### How different is it from any other existing ideas out there?
• Combines version control capabilities with AI-powered content generation and editing by a simple voice command (uses NLP) – no existing solutions.

• Enables direct publishing to social platforms by automating workflows of content, captions, ads hashtags and schedule posts to create engaging content
efficiently. Existing ones still rely on AI solutions for content creation and manual ways of social sharing.

• Collaborate with fellow contributors to make versions even after the content has been released (unlike YT, Instagram where creators create collaborate first
and then create)

• Comprehensive solution for managing content across multiple platforms + leveraging AI to boost creativity and reach wider audience.

### How will it be able to solve the problem?
• Many social media platforms – too much content to handle – We provide one stop platform to create ,filter and manage content panning various social media
platforms.

• No unified avenue for creators’ collaboration – Discover, chat and enhance content with fellow creators to work on creative variations of the content. Maintain
versions flexible to revert to an older needed.

• Language Barriers limit reach : AI-translation of content to a language of choice (text, audio, captions ) to accessible to wider audience.

• Customize content to various socials (Twitter , YouTube,etc.) : Create once and convert videos to twitter threads and images for Instagram with captions or
vice-versa to reduce time invested in converting to various format for multiple platforms

• The need to track the performance of content, reach and optimize strategies

• Its difficult to keep up all latest trends as a creator – We empower creators and artists to follow trends with web-scraped daily news/ suggestions allowing time
for strategies
